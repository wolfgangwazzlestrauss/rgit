RGit is a personal implementation of [Git](https://git-scm.com/). It is a small
project, desgined for learning the requirements of making a full featured
command line appliction in the Rust programming language. RGit is implemented by
following the [DIY Git in Python](https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/) blog posts
and translating the Python code to idiomatic Rust code.

RGit development is designed to follow best practices by implementing testing,
benchmarking, documentation, and deployment.
